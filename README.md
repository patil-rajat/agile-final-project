# Agile Final Project: E-commerce Product Catalog 
This repository contains the final project for an Agile course, which demonstrates the development of the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. The project is managed using Agile methodologies and a GitHub Kanban board for issue tracking and sprint management.

## Overview
The backend system for the e-commerce product catalog supports key operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products. Additionally, it includes functionality for users to like, dislike, list, and query products. The application is hosted in a cloud environment with automated deployments.

### Key Features
- **Product Management**: 
  - Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete (CRUD) products in the catalog.
  - Like and Dislike products.
  - List all products.
  - Query a subset of products based on specific parameters.
- **Cloud Hosting**:
  - The system is hosted on a cloud platform.
  - Automated deployments for continuous integration and delivery without manual intervention.

## Agile Development

The development process is managed using Scrum and Kanban methodologies:
- **Product Backlog**: User stories reflecting stakeholder requirements are maintained in the product backlog.
- **Sprint Planning**: Stories are selected from the product backlog and planned for 2-week sprints.
- **Kanban Board**: The progress of stories is tracked across the board with columns for "Icebox", "Product Backlog", "Sprint Backlog", "In Progress", "Review/QA", and "Done".
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: At the end of each sprint, we reflect on the sprint process and refine the backlog.
